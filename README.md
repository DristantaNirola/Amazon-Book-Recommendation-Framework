# Amazon-Book-Recommendation-Framework

## CHAPTER 1-  OBJECTIVES AND INTRODUCTION 

### 1.1 OBJECTIVE : 
The main objective is to create a machine learning model to recommend relevant books to users based on popularity and user interests.
In addition to the ML Model prediction, we also have taken into account the book recommendation for a totally new user.  

### 1.2 INTRODUCTION:  			

During the last few decades, with the rise of Youtube, Amazon, Netflix, and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives. From e-commerce (suggest to buyers articles that could interest them) to online advertisement (suggest to users the right contents, matching their preferences), recommender systems are today unavoidable in our daily online journeys.   

In a very general way, recommender systems are algorithms aimed at suggesting relevant items to users (items being movies to watch, text to read, products to buy, or anything else depending on industries).   

Recommendation systems are really critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out significantly from competitors. The main objective is to create a book recommendation system for users.   

Since, here we are trying to recommend books to users based on their past purchases or ratings the user gave previously, we are basically trying different models like Popularity based recommender system, Collaborative filtering based recommender system (user-item or item-item) etc. We will be using the Popularity based recommender system to deal with the cold start problem, where we do not have history of past purchases of a particular user or where the user is totally new.  

The next chapters have the following sections which are the steps involved for solving the Book Recommendation System,   
Section 1 - Data collection   
Section 2 - Data preparation  
Section 3 - Exploratory data analysis   
Section 4 - Feature Engineering  
Section 5 - Working different models  
Section 6 - Evaluating model
